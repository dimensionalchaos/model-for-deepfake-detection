## Introduction

This project uses a combination of traditional machine learning techniques (PCA and LDA) and deep learning (CNN) for face real/fake image classification. The goal is to detect whether a given image of a face is real or fake using a deep learning-based Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), combined with additional feature engineering such as PCA, LDA, and LBPH (Local Binary Patterns).
